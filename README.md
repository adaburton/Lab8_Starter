# Lab 8 - Starter
1. The first option. To make sure the code doesn't only work in my local environment, but in a generalized one. Also to minimize the amount of buggy code polluting the codebase, acts as a watchgaurd.
2. No, it would be hard to isolate a single function while testing the entire application. A more specialized unit test would be more appropriate for granular testing of specific functions and variables.
3. No, this functionality should utilize multiple functions, and so one would run a UI test to make sure it is implemented correctly.
4. Yes, This a small, single function, that can easily be tested in isolation from other components.
